### Prerequisits
    - node.js
    - React
    - Material UI

## Installation
    1. Create a database named 'weekend-to-do-app'
    2. Queries in the 'database.sql' are setup to create all the necessary tables and populate them to allow the application to run correctly. This project is built on Postgres so you will need to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that is what was used to create the queries.
    3. Open on the editor of your choice and run 'npm install'
    4. Run 'npm run server' in your terminal
    5. Start a new terminal and run 'npm run client'
        This will also open up a new browser tab.

## Usage
    1. User can add a task by typing it in the Task field and hitting "add task".
    2. Task will automatically populate below sorted showing incomplete tasks first.
    3. If the task is complete the user can click the check box to change the status to complete.
    4. If the check box is accidently clicked, clicking it again will change the status to incomplete.
    5. clicking on the trashcan will remove the task. 

## Built With
